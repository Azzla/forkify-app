# forkify-app
Final project built following along Jonas's course.  Implements modern development tools like NPM, Webpack, and Babel.  Also utilizes advanced DOM manipulation.

The project fetches recipe data from a third-party api via AJAX calls and displays useful information to the user.  Users can like a recipe and it will persist across page reloads.
